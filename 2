# Language primitives
- identifier: a sequence of letters or numbers starting with a letter;
- block: any part of the code between two curly brackets `{block}`, 
  - may be omitted in the furture for a single statement block
  - can contain another block or construct
  - it delimits an area of code called scope
  - a block can omit the `{}` if there is only a single line statement
  - a block can omit the `{}` and end directly with a semicolon to abbreviate the empty block 
- scope: anything inside a scope can use everything inside the same scope and the parents scopes
- statement: combination of caluses and expressions ending with a semicolon `;`
- clauses: one or more characters or symbols defined by the language specifications
- operators: one or more characters or symbols defined by thge language specifications
- expressions: something that needs an evaluation, combination between operators and operands
- operands is defined as one of the following:
  - an expression
  - a literal
- a literal: a pure value of some specific type ( decimal, string, bool, none )
- tag: is a unique identifier that describes the behavior of the subsequent block
- construct: is at least composed by one tag, one identifier and one block
  - action construct: is a construct that can define in its body a **construct action**
  - attribute construct: is a construct that can defined in its body **attributes**
- attribute: is a variable associated with the instance of the construct in which it is defined, the body of the construct defines the scope of the attribute
- comments: a comment is everything till the end of line character from the double slash characters `\\` 
  - they are ignored and are only for informing, documenting or in general leaving messages inside the code
  


# Types 
  
## Object type
the object type is the base type of all the types in the language, you can always upcast (cast to object) to the object type 
to go back to the orignal type from the object type a downcast must be performed.

the object type defines the `to_string()` function to get the representation of a construct / type in string form.
the `to_string()` function can be overriden in the constructs to get custom rapresentation for that construct

```
<construct>
{
  override function to_string
  {
    override effect
    {
      return "custom";
    }
  }
}

```

### ObjectConstruct type
the object construct type is the base type of all the construct types like state, interactables, ect...

it defines the following functions:
- `input_injection(bool change)`: if change is false it disables the instance injector, if state is true it enables  the instance injector

```
<object construct> : object
{
  function input_injection(bool change) { }
}
```

## Predefined types 
TGDL supports a small set of predefined types for simplicity and ease of use for non skilled users.
The standard supported predefined types are:
- decimal: for numbers both integer and floating point
- string: for descriptions or storing text ( no string manipulation is provided and they are not supported in the majority of expression operations )
- bool: boolean values true and false

### String interpolation
strings types have a special, easy to use, way to construct dynamic strings.

interpolated string are defined by prefixing to the string definition the dollar sign `$""`;

in an interpolated string you can define normal string text `$"hello world"` and you can defined interpolated values trough the curly brackets `$"hello {name}"`:
- when interpolating a construct the `to_string()` function will be called.
- when interpoalting a predefined type, formatting information can be attached trough a double dot notation `$"{<value>:<formatting>}"`

the supported predefined type formatting are:
- decimal:
  - decimal precision
  - zero padding
- bool: has no formatting
- string: has no formatting
  
## Supplied predefined types
Supplied predefines types are user declared types ( or defaults if not declared ) that are automatically supplied to 
the consumer action, they are the following types:
- player 
- global states
- board 

## Input types 
Inputs types are choosen by the player or players when required in an action they are:
( **Experimental: input types can be supplied from another action in a callable** )
- local and group states
- tile

## None Value
`none` is a special value that any type can have and it indicates the absence of the value for that specific attribute ( unassigned )

the none value behaves differently than normal types in comparisons:
- if two attributes with none value are confronted they will always be different `attribute1 = attribute2 => falls if attribute1 and attribute2 are none`
- an attribute with none value is equals to a none literal `attribute == none -> true if attribute is none`
- a none literal is equals to another none literal `none == none => true`

## Lists
List are a set of multiple instances of the same type that are aggregated under a single named variable.

| operation | syntax | explanation |
| --------- | ------ | ----------- |
| Declaration | `type[] <list_name>` | defines a variable of type list of type |                                           
Access to a single instance | `<list_name>[decimal]` | returns the instance at the position ( decimal part is ignored, if not found it will return none ) |
List Lenght | `<list_name>.length` | returns the last used index + 1 |
Inserting | `<list_name>[decimal] = <instance>` | inserts an instance at the index ( if decimal > lenght, it extends the list ) | 
Initialization | `type[] <list_name> = { [<instance>, <instance2>, <instance3>] };` | creates a list and initializes its value |
| Appending | `<list>.append(<other>)` | appends the list other to the list list |
| Clearing a list | `<list>.clear()` | removes all entries from the list, returning it to an empty list |
| Check if list has value | `<list>.contains(<value>)` | returns true if value is inside list |
| Find element index| `<list>.find(<value>)` | returns the key if value is found, otherwise none | 
| Remove element at index| `<list>.removeAt(<decimal index>)` | removes the value at the index |
| Remove element| `<list>.remove(<value>)` | removes the value from the list |
| Remove a list| `<list>.removeRange(<other_list>)` | removes all the elements of other_list from list |
| Shuffle a list| `<list>.shuffle()` | shuffles the current list |
| Get a copy of the list| `<list>.copy()` |  returns a new list with the same elements |

## Type checking
Type checking is done trough the `is` keyword: `<attribute> is <type>` is a type checkign expression and will return true if the attribute
is of type `<type>`, otherwise return false

## Type casting
type casting is used to change an attribute from a type to another type, it is done trough the `as` keyword `<type> id = <val> as <type>`
the as expression has two possible returns:
- the variable with the new type if it is allowed
- none if the variable is not allowed to be of the new type

# Expressions 
An expression is a combination of one operator and one or more operands.
Every type of expression defines the result type and legal operands.

## Binary Operations
A binary operation is defined as an expression that involves two operands and one operators.
they are left associative by default, if otherwise it will noted as such.

### Math Operation
Math operations only allow **decimal** operands and as result a **decimal** type:
- addition: `<operand> + <operand>`
- substraction: `<operand> - <operand>`
- multiplication: `<operand> * <operand>`
- division: `<operand> / <operand>`
- power: `<operand> ^ <operand>` ( right associative )
- modulo: `<operand> % <operand>`

### Comparison Operations
Comparison operations only allow **decimal** operands and as result a **bool** type:
- less than: `<operand> < <operand>`
- greater than: `<operand> > <operand>`
- less or equal than: `<operand> <= <operand>`
- greater or equal than: `<operand> >= <operand>`

### Equality Operations
equality operations allow both **decimal** or **boolean** operands, the two operands must be of the same type in the same operation,
and as result **bool** type;
- equal: `<operand> == <operand>`
- not equal: `<operand> != <operand>`

### Logic Operations
logic operations only allow **boolean** values and as result **bool** type
- and: `<operand> and <operand>`
- or: `<operand> or <operand>`
- xor: `<operand> xor <operand>`
- nand: `<operand> nand <operand>`

### Generic operations
generic operations don't fall under a specific category:
- state attribute access: '<state>.<attribute>'
- is operation: `<construct> is <type>`: returns a boolean value, true if the construct is of type otherwise false

## Unary Operations
A unary operation is defines as an expression that involves one operand and one operator, the following are supported in TGDL:
- plus: `+<operand>`
- minus: `-<operand>`
- not: `not <operand>`

### Instantiation Expression
```
new <attribute construct>();
```

returns a new instance of the attribute construct, to avoid event generation when changing the attributes an attribute intializer list can be used to initialize the attributs of the construct

```
new <attribute construct>()
{
  <attribute name> = <value>; // attribute assignemnet statement
}
```

## Order of evaluation
1. state attribute acces
2. plus and minus
4. pow
5. multiplication, division and modulo
6. addition and subtraction
7. comparison operations
8. equality operations
9. not
10. and
11. or

# Statement
a stamentent is a combination of clauses and expressions that end with a semicolon, the following are supported in TGDL
- return: `return <expression>;`
- expression: `expression;` 
- assignment: `<attribute or variable> = <expression>;`
- declaration: `<type> <attribute or variable>;`
  - an assignemnt can be chained to perform an initialization of the declared variable or state attribute
- turn: `pass expression;`

anything that isn't an expression or a body is a clause (ex. return, =, if, while, pass, ...).

## Flow Control statements
- if: `if expression {}`
  - else: `else {}`
  - else if `if {} else if {}` 
- while: `while expression {}`
  - break: exits the while without evalueting the expression
  - continue: goes to next iteration (it evalueates the expression, if false exits)
- for: `for(init expresison; boolean expression, post expression)`:

# Actions
actions are a combination of instructions set by the user that are run on a trigger.
actions are specials functions that have no return type but have a more flexible functionalities thanks to requires, triggers

example:
```
action <action>
{
  input   { }
  require { }
  trigger { }
  effect  { }
}
```

an action can have any combination of the other tags **input, require, trigger and effect**:
- **WARNING**: if an action has no triggers it will never be called

all actions can be called using the parenthesis operator `()` 

## Inputs
An action input are the constructs that will be used troughtout the action definition and execution.
It works trough method dependency injection following the subsequent rules:
1. if its a supplied type it will be supplied from the translation / interpreter
2. if its a declared type it will be asked to the user to choose (if the require are satisfied else no choice is given and the action fails, check action fail):
3. if its a Predefined types it will ask the user to choose ( if possible restrict the values so that it will always satisfy the require, or give an indication when satisfied)

```
[optional] [<modifier>] input <type> <idenfitier>
{
  filters
}
```

**Attention**: every action in the action substate of a specific state has as automatic input its value substate ( this could generate a name conflict if an input
has the same identifier of an attribute of its value substate)

Inputs can be used inside an effect, it will instantiate a variable with the defined type and identifier that can be used only inside the scope of the effect.
Effect Inputs have the same behavior of Action inputs.

### Input Filters
Input filters can be defined using a block after the input statement that returns a boolean value, true if the current examined value passes the filters or false if it does not pass the filter.

an input filter reduces the possible selections from all the instances of a certain type to a specfici subtype satisfying the given filter

```
input <type> <name>
{
  <statements>
}

// alternative input filter declaration
input <type> <name>
{
  filter [<type> <name>]
  {

  }
}
```

alternative filter declaration uses the filter keyword ( only accessible in the input context block ) that defines a filter for the 
specific type, used generally for list filters ( see input filters for list ), and a generic filter that derives the type and name of the
object to filter on from the input parameters.

multiple filters mapped on the same type will be evalueated one after the other, if one fails the input fails.

an example can be of an action that can be applied only on states with higher points
```
state player_state
{
  decimal points = 0;

  action on_higher_points
  {
    input player_state other
    {
      return other.points > points;
    }
  }
}
```

**WARNING INPUT FILTER FOR LIST**
to have better control on a list, its input filters need two separate definitions one to filter for the instances that will go in the list
and one to filter if the list is in an allowed state or if the input will fail.

**ATTENTION input lists cannot be used with predefined types**

```
state example 
{
  decimal points = 0;
}

action list_input
{
  input example[] examples 
  {
    filter example ex 
    {
      return ex.points < 10 and ex.points > 0;
    }
    filter
    {
      return examples.lenght < 3 and examples.lenght > 0;
    }
  }
}
```

first the filter for a single example type is run so that the player can choose between one of the choices,
after every selection made by the users the generic filter runs to check if the lists fails the check thus failing the input

**ATTENTION** to get all of a non literal type in a list the **all** keyword can be appened to the input statement, if a all keyword is used
there should no input filters.
the all keyword bypasses the need for a player to select the input

inputs are resolved in order of definition and subsequent inputs can use result of the previous input 

### Input Modifiers
Input modifiers are needed to modify the behavior of the input tag, they are appened after the default definition input
```
input <type> <identifier> [<modifier>] [{ filter }]
```
the possible modifiers are:
- `player [<decimal>]` : ask a player for input, it is the default input if no number is given the current player is used
- `auto`: no player input, filter from all the avalaible instances of the requested type. If not filter is given all instances will be accepted.
  - exceptions: if no type satisfies the defined filter if the input type is a list it will return none if optional else the action will fail
- `function`: special input  that can be used only in functions, defines inputs that need to be passed trough the calling statement
  
### Optional Inputs
an optional input defines in the its definition the `optional` keyword and it means that input can assume the value of none when no input is given by the
corresponding player or no input satisfies the defined filters 

## Triggers
A trigger is a body of statementes than when evalueated true will launch the corresponding effects

```
trigger <trigger event> [<params>]
{
  <statements>
}
```

possible triggers events are:
- `movement <movement>`
- `<state>.action` ( < state > can not be in input )
- `change <state>.value`
- `<state>.<action>.<phase>` 

a trigger event is formed by 3 pieces: `on <target> <event>`:
- on is the keyword that defines the trigger event
- event is the event of the macro category

for each construct you can use specific constructs that were defined by the programmer like a specific state, or a general construct that is identifier by the identifier name of that construct ( ex. state will encompass all the states )

inheritance works for targets too, a derivated target will generate the events both with its type and for the base type ( walking back the inheritance hierarchy )

so for an efficient event passing you should narrow down the event to the most specific target possible so that the trigger needs to check only a minimum number of events 

### Events general functions and data
the `events` object contains the generic functions and data:
- `stop()`  : stops the generation of the events
- `start()` : starts the generation of the events

the `stop()` and `start()` functions are powerfull and but dangerous, they allow for a better performance and to **globally** stop the generation of the events.

### Trigger Modifiers
```
trigger <event> [for <name>] [<modifier>]
```
the possible triggers modifiers are:
- after: the trigger activates the effect after the triggering action terminated
- before: the trigger activates the effect before the triggering action is started
- fast: as soon as the event is thrown the triggers will evalueate

## Phases
Phases are introduces for multi effect actions with different requirements and / or triggers.
A phase declaration can only contain trigger, require and effect


a phase is declared like in the following example.
```
phase
{
  input { }
  trigger { }
  require { }
  effect { }
}
```

withinh a phase scope you can define:
- new inputs that are added to the global action inputs
- new triggers that concernt only the phase
- require tags that define when the phase is active 
- effects that work the same as the action effects

## Action priority 
As default the actions are executed in the same order as they are defined in the file, that equals a priority of value 0.
An action priority can be changed trough the keyword `priority <decimal>` that assigns a arbitrary priority to the action.
a lower number or means a lower priority and viceversa a higher number means an higher priority

example:
```
action low_prio priority -10 {}
action default_prio {}
action default_prio_spec priority 0 {}
action high_prio priority 10 {}
```

## Action transaction
a player action creates a tree of changes trough its effects and the effects of the triggered actions called a transaction.
if a transaction has failures all the transaction is cancelled and its effects are reverted

### Action Failures
an action fails when a it reaches a failure statement:
- `fail "message";` -> fails the entirety of the transaction
- `cancel [<effect>] "message"` -> 
  - if no effect is specified fails only the global effect and stops all the triggers from activating ( and reverts the triggers that activated with the before keyword )
  - if an effect is specified it fails that specific effect
  - if `all` is specified for effects the entire action fails without propagating backwards to the trigger action 

# State
A state is a construct to describe values and actions related to eachothers such as roles.
a state is divided in two substates, the value substate and the action substate.

a state can be refer to itself in the actions trough the use of the `this` keyword that means this instance of the construct

a state has reference to the player or players that are associated with:
- `<state>.player` works only for local states and returns the player associated with that specific instance of the state
- `<state>.players` is used for local and group states and return all the players that have that specific state  

## Attributes
Attributes are defined trough the attribute tag inside an attribute construct

```
<attribute construct> <identifier>
{
  attribute <identifier>
  {
    returns <type>;
    default { return <value>; } 
  }
}
```

but because it is a cumbersome and too verbose of a syntax just for defining an attribute, they can be defined with a variable definition and  initialization statement. 

```
state <state>
{
  <type> <identifier> = <default>; // default can be a none value
}
```

the **none** keyword rapresents the absence of an assigned value to an attribute and it is the default for every type if assigned a default initializer value.

## State Scopes
State scopes change the behaviour and attachment of a state to a player

### Local
```
local state <state>
```
the local scope is the default scope, they are transferrable state with a unique instance for each player that it was assigned it.
local states are the meat of a TGDL program and manage abstractions such as roles, default player actions, ect...

### Groups 
```
group state <state>
```
the group scope defines a state that has one instance assigned to a subgroup of players.
players can be assigned or removed from the group state trough a transfer.

group states serve the purpose of having values or actions shared between a subset of players 

**WARNING:** at the moment only one instance of a defined group state is allowed due to syntax restrictions in defining multiple instances 

### Global
```
global state <state>
```
the global scope defines a state that has only one instance and cannot be assigned to any player, the ownership of the global state is the game itself.
a global state defines values and actions that encompass values outside of the players but that can be influenced from them in some shape o form.

an example of a global state use case is the presence of global parameters that dictate the flow of the game, the parameters have no attached player to them
but the are still a part of the game.

global states are a supplied type, **no other identifier can be the same as a global state name**

## Transferability

### Local states
local states can be transferred from a player to another player trough the **transfer** operation.
The transfer keeps the value state constant during the transfer opereration ( a special trigger can be setup to reset/change the value substate on transfer to another player ).

the player that acquired the state can now access the state substates, on the other hand the other player has lost the rights to access the substates of the transferred state

```
<state>.transfer_to(player destination); // transfer the current state from current player to destination player
```

## Group states
a group states cannot be transferred as a local state, the transfer operations change the attachments of players to the group states.
players can be removed or attached to a group state, acquiring the access to its substates.

actions can be specified with special triggers ( on remove and on attach ) to perform actions on the respective removal or attachment of a player to the group state
( this special trigger, can be specialized with a state name to trigger only when attached or deattached from that specific state )

**WARNING:** the special triggers are available to local states as well

# Interactables 
interactables are objects that abstract the concept of interaction with the player trough phisical objects like tokens, cards, ect...

```
interactable <name> [<type>|<type>,<type>,...]
```

## Placeable
Placeable is a type of interatable, it interacts with tiles and board groups
Placeable have specialized triggers to enhance their functions (defined in the respective section reletaed to action triggers):

a placeable stores a reference to the tile that it occupies ( if not placed the tiles is none ).
and viceversa a tiles stores the reference to all the placeable placed on itself trough a placeable list

# Stack
Stack are used to define a pile of interactables, a stack is a attribute and action construct.

```
stack <identifier> 
{
  default
  {
  }
}
```
the default tag of the stack defines how the stack is defined when it is instanced.
it must return a list of interactables that wil be become the order of the stack where
the top of the stack is the last index of the list, and the front of the stack is the first index of the list.

**warning** the list is checked for none values and will crash the program if there is a null value.

## Pop expression
```
<stack>.pop() // returns one interactable
<stack>.pop(decimal n) // returns n interactables, if there are less then n it will return the remaining

// functions to pop from the back of the stack
<stack>.pop_back() 
<stack>.pop_back(decimal n)
```

## Push expression
the push operation on the stack has two forms
```
<stack>.push(interactable item)   // pushes one single item to the front
<stack>.push(interactable[] list) // pushes a list to the front

<stack>.push_back(interactable item)   // pushes one single item to the back 
<stack>.push_back(interactable[] list) // pushes a list to the back
```

# Players
A player is defined as a decimal, every state has a hidden state attribute called `player` that corresponds to the player to which the state is attached to.

## General Data and functions
the general data and functions of the players are stored in the object that has the same name `players`.

the object has:
- `all()`: returns the list of all players
- `active()`: returns the current active player

## Starting player
the starting player is always the player numbered 0.

## Winner selection and game end
`winner <player> [,<player>]*`: sets the winner or winners for the game and afterwards ends the program

## Player expressions
a player expression is a special expression that returns a player object

a player is identifier with a number from 0 to (number of players - 1) and they can be used as numbers with the exception
that if a player object is used in an expression it becomes a player expression and it will always return the result by applying the following formula 
```
{
  r modP              r >= 0
  (P - |r|modP)modP   r <  0 
}
```
where:
- r = the result of the expression
- P = the number of players in the game
- mod = the modulo operator 

the formula ensures that the result of the **player expression** is always a number between 0 and and the (number of players - 1) so that it can be mapped 
automatically to one of the players objects.
Furthermore it allows easy to use operations on the player objects to retrieve a player form another player number trough its cyclicity forward and backwards

some examples to demistify the formula, all the exaples will have a number of players equal to 4 ( common in table top games ) and starting player (player = 3):
`player + 1 => player 0`
`player - 1 => player 2`
`player +- 4 => player 3`
`player + 5 => player 0`
`player - 5 => player 2`

## Turns
A turn defines the flow of the game by using phases, it is fundemental to any game.

to pass a turn the `pass` keyword is used: `pass [<player expression>] [to <turn phase>];` 
- the result of the player expression will be the active player
- a specific phase of the current active turn can be selected with the `to <turn phase>` optional parameter
- **ATTENTION**: a pass call doesn't terminate the current active branch, so if another pass call is used the previous will be overridden ( as if the previous pass call was never executed )

```
// the simplest turn is defined as the following
turn <identifier>
{
  default
  {
    pass player + 1;
  }
}

// examples with phases 
turn <identifier>
{
  phase A {}
  default
  {
    pass player + 1 to A;
  }
}
```

if there is a need for multiple turns the current active turn can be changed by using the `use` keyword, or more specifically:
```
use turn <turn identifier>;
```

**ATTENTION phases can contain effects like in an action that is run when the phase is activated before phase events are generated**

### Turns Data and Functions
the `turns` object contains all the general functions and nice to have data:
- `active()`: returns the current active turn
- `phase.active()`: returns the current active phase of the turn

### Default turn
The default turn, or default section of the turn, is the block of code that is called on a default `pass` call
The default section has access to the global constructs like global states, boards, ect... furthermore inside the default tag two more arguments can be used by default:
- player: identifies the current active player 
- phase: identifies the current active phase

these arguments can be used to define complex turns flows partially detaching them from the code base trough an agnostic default pass call

**ATTENTION**: a `pass` call if used with arguments like `player expression` or `phase specificier` will cease to be a default pass call and **won't** call the default section
```
// sample turn used for the following two examples of normally used turn flows
// obviously the default tag would've been inside the turn
turn A
{
  phase A1 {}
  phase A2 {}
}

// example single vertical turn: a player must do all the phases then second player ect...
default 
{
  if(phase == A1) 
  { 
    pass player to A2; 
  }
  else 
  {
    pass player + 1 to A1;
  }
}

// example every player does phase before passing to next phase
default
{
  if(player != <number of players> - 1)
  {
    pass player + 1 to phase; // pass the next player to the same phase
  }
  else
  {
    if(phase == A1)
    {
      pass player 0 to A2; // 0 could be substituted with a global state player attribute that is changed if the first player changes 
    }
    else
    {
      pass player 0 to A1;
    }
  }
}

```

# Board
the board is the construct used to rapresent something that can be interacted with by the players trough placing tokens, claiming cells or other actions.
it is globally defined, meaning there is only one instance of the board in the entire game, a board can have attributes.

## Tile 
a tile is a specialized state-like definition trough the **tile** keyword, it can have multiple instances of the same declaration like local states and players.

```
tile <cellname>
{
  <attributes>
  <actions>
}
```

the concept of tile is abstracted by its geometrical nature that is defined by the group type

tiles have two implicit attributes:
- `board`: reference to the global board
- `group`: reference to the group in which they are attached

to do group manipulation or other that requires a specific group, type checking and casting can be used
```
if(<tile>.group is <group>)
{
  <group> <id> = <tile>.group as <group>;
}
``` 

## Groups
a board contains groups of tiles, every group can contain only one type of cell between the following:
- hex cells
- square cells
- adjacency324wee

like the board, a group is globally defined and can have attributes ( they are declaration and assignement statement inside the group beside the group tiles definition)

all the groups can contain the blank cell (used only for spacing is an empty space) used in the group declaration with the keyword `b`
the cell type is used to define default terms like **adjancency** and **coordinates**,   

you can access a group tiles by using the square brackets operators like if it was a grid of tiles `group[x][y]`;
if the selected coordinates has a blank tile or no tile associated with it will return a `none`

Example
```
board
{
  group square <name> 
  {
    <cell>, <cell>, ...
    <cell>, ...
    <cell>, <cell>, ...
    <cell>, <cell>, ...
  }
}
```

all the groups can be access in order of definition from the board object trough the `boards` lists 

if a specific group is needed it can be accessed trough its name from the board object

### Hex cell type
an hex cell group can have two orientations, **column** (face side up) or **row** (point up), that define the overall look of the board group and changes how the group definition is interpreted

col definition has even rows displaced by one unit from the top.
row definition has even rows displaced by one unit to the right.

in column orientation a line from left to right equals a column from top to bottom.
in row orientation a line from left to right equals a row from left to right.

for coordinates in both column and row orientation the origin hex is the one in the upper left (0,0)
- in rows the first number is the row and the second is the position of the hex in the row from the left 
- incols the first number is the column and the second is the position fo the hex in the column from the top

<img src="images/board/hex_col_coords.png" />
</span>

distance is defined as the following = abs(x_1 - x_0 + y_1 - y_0)



examples with a defined tile
```
tile h 
{
  <attribute>
  <attribute>
  
  <action>
  <action>
  <action>
}
```

<tr>

} 
```
</td>

</table>

by default all hexagons are adjcency with their neighbors, it is possible do modify the adjancency rules in a group using the adjacency keyword and the correspective coordinates
```
group <name> hex col
{
  h,h,h;
  h,h,h;
  h,h,h;

  adjency
  {
    (0,0) -> (2,2); // for one way adjacency
    (0,0) <-> (2,2); // for two way adjacency
    (0,0) 1 <-> 3 (2,2); // specify distance between adjacencies ( default is 1)
    (0,0) x-> (0,1); // one way removal of adjacency
    (0,0) x-x (0,1); // two way removal of adjacency 
  }
}
```

### Square cell type
square cell has the same distance, line, coordinates and adjacency rules of an hex type cell with the following exceptions:
- there are no orientations distinctions
- coordinates have origin (0,0) at top left, the first number is the row the second is the column.
- square cells have two type of default adjcency: **around** or **sides**

### Adjacency cell type
adjacency cell types are different from both hex and square types in that they can rapresent any kind of board by using a graph notation:
- nodes are the cells
- edges are the adjacency and define the distance between the nodes that connect

```
group <name> adjency
{
  <id1> -> 3 <id2> 
}
```

### Border Cells
A border cells is a cell that connects to another group cell.

The definition syntax is the same as a the adjacency list, because the bordercells list is a glorified adjacency list starting off as empty 

```
board
{
  group first {}
  group second {}
  tiles
  {
    <first.cell> -> <second.cell>
    <first.cell> <-> <second.cell>
  }
}
```

# Movement 
Movement is the act of removing a placeable from a boarder cell and placing in another boardercell.
Custom movements can be defined trough default terms and movement operators. with an action-like syntax

to move a placeable interactable the following syntax is used:
```
<placeable>.move_to(tile t);
```

if there is a need for complex movements, like line, obstructions ect... functions should be used

# Setup
The setup is the initial stage of the game where everything is put in place before the first player action is played.
```
setup { }
```
the setup can have inputs and effects:
- allowed inputs are the types that do not require an input from a player (global inputs)
  - lists of types with all keyword ( players, states, ect...)
  - any of the global types like board, global states, groups, stacks
- as all statement blocks it can interact trough the dictionary method with any of the instances or class

# Functions
Functions are a definition to group and reuse a certain set of statements on a specific set of inputs

```
function <name>
{
  input {}
  effect {}
  returns <type>;
}
```

it has some special rules:
- multiple inputs
- no triggers or requires

it is the equivalent to a function in other programming languages with the addition of dependency injection (Inversion of control ?) trough the inputs.

it has a return type that is defined automatically trough it's return statements ( that must all return the same type ).
If there is a need to return a base construct trough different derived constructs upcasting must be used trough the as keyword ( it can return null, caller has the responsability of null checking )

the `returns <type>;` keyword is a empty block tag used to indicate the return type of a tag block ( like in attributes and functions ).

if the effect is not defined ( abstract like function ) a return type must be defined,
the compiler needs to know what inputs and return type the function has.

to call a function the parenthesis operator is used `(identifier1: value1, identifier2: value2)` where identifier is one of the function input identifiers defined in the function
definition and value is the value that will be passed to the function call for that specific input identifier.

**ATTENTION: functions can be defined inside a construct and called trough <construct>.<function>()**

# Inheritances
Inheritance permits a construct to derive actions, attributes and type from a base construct while having the possibility of modifying the behavior trough 
the base construct can be referenced from the overrides trough the `base` keyword that has the same behavior as the this keyword but for the base construct.

inheritance works the same for each construct

```
state base { }
state derived : base { }
```

for interactable you can add types of interactables 
```
interactable base placeable {}
interactable derived stackable : base {} // derived is both a stackable and placeable ( inherited from base )
```

you can defined the same interactable type of the base in the derived it will be simply ignored
```
interactable base placeable {}
interactable derived stackable, placeable : base {} // placeable is ignored , in the case that base is changed 
```

**ATTENTION**: the type check expression will still give the same result with a base type as with the derived type, the base type 
when upcasted from a derived type is just a different interactable interface it doesn't change the underlying type of the "physical"
instance on which one is interacting

## Override
the overrides obviusly change the intended behavior of a block of code, this changes are a responsability of the user to not create conflicts with 
the base construct code 

an action override is an a replacement for a specific part of an action of the base construct, partial overrides include:
- triggers
- effect
- require
- inputs

when overriding an action everything that has not the same declaration of the base construct is added.
if inputs are removed the base construct cannot be invoked inside the effect 
  
by marking an action as **override** it will give an error if the base as no equivalent in the base class 
also if an a derived class has an override that is not marked with the override key it will throw a syntax error.

### Function Override
when overriding a construct function ( function defined in a construct ) the only overridable part 
is the global effect.

**ATTENTION** the functions inputs can't be changed in an overriden function, but any auto or player input can be added.

when overriding a function, the return type must match with the base function definition, so if the return type is implicitly defined trough the effect tag, the overriding function must have that same type.

when creating an empty function to mimic a prototype/abstract like definition of the function,
the effect tag should be omitted forcing the user to defined the return type trough the return tag.

# Player information
Which information can the player see about the written code ?

## Information tag
the information tag is used to display usefull information for player choice, it has 
two important subtags that are used for abbrevieted form ( short tag ) and a fuller, more explanatory form ( long tag );
```
information {
  short { return "short"; }
  long { return "long"; }
}
```

each tag must return a string that will be shown to the users.
multiple short or long tag are used to split up the informatino in multiple paragraphs

### Input tag behavior
when an information tag is used inside an input tag it will be used as a user prompt.
the informatino tag is allowed only in player inputs and when used it forces the explicit filter 
if one is needed.

```
player input ...
{
  filter { }
  information { return "input promp"; }
}
```

# Multiple Files
Multiple files are supported by using `import <relative path to file> [as <name>]`
to access the content of the file:
- if there's no name conflict use the normal identifier
- if there's a conflict to differentiate it is possible to use the `as name` import syntax, the content of the file is accessible trough by prefixing `name.`

the entry point of the program and main file is the one with the game tag.
there can only be one setup in the whole "project".

```
// ext.tgdl
state ext { }

// setup.tgdl
setup { }

// main.tgdl
game "game";

import "ext.tgdl" as ext/
import "setup.tgdl";

```

# Garbage collection and instance injector
While a reference to a construct exists the corresponding memory space it is not fred and it is usable
by the InstanceInjector for the input mechanism.

when creating a variable the tracking is disabled and it is automatically enables when the reference is assigned to a attribute in an attribute construct

**WARNING:** an object with manually enabled tracking is still freed when there are no more references to the object.

a nice to have feature deriving from the way the tracking works is to have variables in the input by enableing 
the injection tracking on a construct variable, this effectevely turns into temporary inputs that are used only inside the scope where they are defined and discared at the end of the scope.

# Conventions
TGDL has suggested naming conventions:
- Lower case snake case for:
  - functions
  - actions
  - attributes
- CamelCase ( Starting with the first letter in UpperCase):
  - construct identifiers
  
# Filters
a filter can be defined as a construct with one effect tag inside of it that returns a boolean

a filter has a `filter input` tag that is a empty block tag

```
filter <identifier>
{
  filter input <type> <variable_identifier>; 
  effect
  {
    return true;
  }
}
```

a filter can be used trough its identifier in a input tag
```
input <type> <variable_identifier>
{
  filter <identifier>; // the compiler will give an error if <type> of <identifier> and <type> are not the same
}
```
